This script does exactly what it says - it hides contextual ads within a page so you, the user, can once again safely mouse over your browser window. Currently, version 8.2 will block ads from Vibrant Media (IntelliTXT), AdBrite, Infolicious (lingoSpot), Kontera, Linkworth, EchoTopic, Targetpoint and MediaText.

Version 8.2 re-fixes Linkworth and Vibrant Media blocking - apologies for the rapid version changes.

Credit to Brian Donovan for the basic approach. his JS is clearly better than mine. Credit to Mike for the original code for blocking Linkworth ads, and Decriptor for additional Linkworth and Vibrant Media blocking code.
